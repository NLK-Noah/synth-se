\section{Introduction}

Hi everyone! I’m Noah, a 2nd-year Bachelor’s student in Computer Science at UCLouvain.\\

Today, I will talk about what happens after our bachelor’s degree,
when we will choose a master’s and our future career paths. \\

My goal is to help you make this important decision.\\

I will introduce the Master’s in Software Engineering and Programming Systems.\\  
First, we will see what this program is about.  \\

Then, we’ll explore what you can do after completing it.\\  
Finally, I’ll talk about where it’s located.\\

Let’s see what’s next after the bachelor’s degree!

\section{What is it?}

To join this Master’s program, you need a university bachelor’s degree or 
a bridging program in Computer Science. \\
After that, you can choose the Master’s in Computer Science.\\ 
This Master’s has many specializations, and I will talk about Software Engineering and Programming Systems.\\

The Master’s program has a total of 120 credits over two years. It includes:  \\
For example

\begin{enumerate} 
   \item A Professional Integration Work module,  
   \item A Graduation Project,  
    \item And a Seminar Program.  
\end{enumerate}
The seminar program lets you explore the world of research. \\

You can choose one of three specializations:  \\
\begin{enumerate} 
   \item Networking and Security,  
    \item Software Engineering and Programming Systems,  
   \item Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  
\end{enumerate}

If you choose Software Engineering and Programming Systems, you will study four main courses: \\ 
\begin{enumerate} 
  \item Software Modeling,  
   \item Software Quality*,  
   \item Programming Languages*,  
    \item And *Algorithms*.  
\end{enumerate}

You can also choose two courses from other specializations, like: \\
\begin{enumerate} 
 \item Medical Informatics,  
  \item Cybersecurity,  
  \item Applied Mathematics, 
\end{enumerate}
Or in Languages, Economics, Politics, tutoring bachelor’s students, 
or Entrepreneurship.  \\


\section{Future Prospects}

After this Master’s, you can do a Doctorat and a PhD in Engineering Sciences 
if you want to become a professor.  \\

Or you can start working as a software engineer. \\ 

If you want to start your own software company, this program will give you the tools to do that.\\

\section{Location}

This Master’s program is offered at EPL in Louvain-la-Neuve, \\
so we’ll most likely live there. However, in the second year, \\
you can choose to study in another country if you want to learn a new language.

\section{Conclusion}

For the conclusion , the Master’s in Computer Science is a flexible program that \\
prepares you for careers in research, industry, or starting your own business. \\
With options to specialize, study abroad, and customize your courses, it’s a great choice \\
for your future.  \\

Thank you for listening!
